Expected the HTML found at $('img') to have no violations:

<img src="#">

Received:

Images must have alternate text (image-alt)

Fix any of the following:
  Element does not have an alt attribute
  aria-label attribute does not exist or is empty
  aria-labelledby attribute does not exist, references elements that do not exist or references elements that are empty
  Element has no title attribute or the title attribute is empty
  Element's default semantics were not overridden with role="presentation"
  Element's default semantics were not overridden with role="none"
